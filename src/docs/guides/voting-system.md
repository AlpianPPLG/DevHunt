# Understanding the Voting System

Learn how DevHunt's voting system works and how to participate effectively in the community.

## üó≥Ô∏è How Voting Works

DevHunt uses a democratic voting system that allows community members to express their opinions about tools and influence their visibility on the platform.

### Types of Votes
- **Upvotes**: Indicate approval or appreciation for a tool
- **Downvotes**: Signal that a tool is low-quality or inappropriate
- **Neutral**: No vote (default state)

### Voting Mechanics
- Each user gets one vote per tool (up or down)
- You can change your vote at any time
- Votes from verified users carry more weight
- New accounts may have temporary voting restrictions

## üìà Impact of Voting

### Trending Algorithm
Votes are a crucial factor in determining which tools appear in the "Trending" section. The algorithm considers:

1. **Recent Votes**: Votes from the last 24 hours (10x weight)
2. **Weekly Votes**: Votes from the last 7 days (3x weight)
3. **Total Votes**: Overall vote count (baseline)
4. **Recency Boost**: New products get a boost for the first 7 days

### Tool Visibility
- Highly voted tools appear more prominently
- Tools with many downvotes may be flagged for review
- Voting affects search result rankings
- Collections may prioritize highly voted tools

### User Reputation
- Your voting patterns contribute to your community reputation
- Consistent, thoughtful voting builds credibility
- Manipulative voting may result in restrictions
